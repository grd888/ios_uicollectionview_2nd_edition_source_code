# ios_uicollectionview_2nd_edition_source_code
Source code from the book iOS UICollectionView The Complete Guide for XCode 9

## Objective C
The original code was written in Objective C and some of the code especially the nib files are not compatible with Xcode 9.

I have created new Xcode projects from scratch so that the Objective C code will compile and run.

## Swift 4
I have also translated the code to Swift 4

NB: I have created this repo for my own reference and use in my own projects. However, feel free to use it and suggest improvements to the code.
